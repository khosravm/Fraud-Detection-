**Fraud Detection:**

Fraud detection is a special instance of a broader problem referred to as anomaly detection or outlier detection. The latter generally includes techniques to identify items that are rare or differ significantly from the “normal” behavior, observable in the majority of the data.

Fraud is a deliberate act of deception to access valuable resources. In the online business world, fraud, scams, and bad agents are damaging in many different ways. Fraudulent activities include money laundering, cyberattacks, fraudulent banking claims, forged bank checks, identity theft, and many such illegal practices.

**Domains of Application:**

Fraud takes on many forms, and it adapts to every business model. Businesses that are most at risk for financial fraud should have at least some fraud detection measures in place. These can include banks, credit card companies, insurance firms, and businesses that conduct significant online transactions. While any business carries some risk of being defrauded, companies with large transaction amounts, high numbers of transactions, or contactless business models are at a greater risk for fraud.
